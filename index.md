## GEOB 472 Mapping with WebVR Assignment:
## What and Where is Public Art?

Author: Alec Francis

For this assignment, I was interested in showing changes to the urban landscape and built environment through the medium of virtual reality. originally, I created a 3D map of the entire downtown peninsula and the changes in buildings from 1999-2009. This was done in QGIS and ultimately the file size of the exported glb file was so large as to be unwieldy. I thus settled for a focus on the Yaletown area of North False Creek. Yaletown is located on what used to be industrial land but since Expo 86 has seen rapid and extensive development (which is ongoing). Since Vancouver is know for its high rise developments, one of the goals of my visualisation was to see how the heights of the building developments built since 1999 compared to those built before.

The project began with several datasets: 1 meter orthophotos of the Downtown peninsula, a 30m digital elevation model (DEM), and building footprint files of the city's buildings in 1999 and 2009 (which included heights and other data). 

Visual design is also an important element of interactive mapping. Roth (2017) writes: "the visual look and feel of the UI design is 'more than just icing on the cake': it sets the tone for the entire user experience". To this end, I attempted to make a map which did not sacrifice visual appeal to interactivity. I used <a href = 'http://colorbrewer2.org/' title = "Colorbrewer" target = "_blank">colorbrewer</a> to generate gradient color schemes for the two layers and I tried to use a colour scheme that is easy to look at. I chose the mapbox dark style as I found it to be the least visually intrusive of the premade mapbox styles.
